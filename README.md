# coding_dojo_project

This will be a project with a demo website for ordering my favorite thing: breakfast food. 

The main features I want to include are: 
-Login and Registration Page
-A static toolbar across the top. 
-Allow users to add favorite orders to their account.
-Have the "cart" part of the toolbar track how many items are in the cart regardless of page.
-Have a random order button that orders a random breakfast item for the user.
-Delivery fees and tax for my state(WA) auto calculated.

The features I would like to try and add, should time allow:
-Add in Stripe API for mock purchases.
-Allow for different delivery addresses from the one the customer made on account creation. 

A big thing I'm also trying to do is work hard at learning a new front end framework with ULKIT. It's not really a feature, but I want my page to look really good.
